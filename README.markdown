SDL OpenGL Intro Read Me

This is a heavily refactored fork of the SDLOpenGLIntro SDL2 tutorial, which
may be found here:

https://github.com/meandmark/SDLOpenGLIntro

This version uses CMake as the build system and is written for exception safety, using C++11.

The program provides a simple example of a SDL program that uses OpenGL. It
creates a window and draws a purple rectangle in the window. Press a key on the
keyboard or close the window to quit the program.

This program provides a nice starting point for those of you interested in
using SDL and OpenGL in your games as well as anyone learning OpenGL.
