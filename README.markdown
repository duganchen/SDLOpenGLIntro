SDL OpenGL Intro Read Me
========================

The program provides a simple example of a SDL program that uses OpenGL. It creates a window and draws a purple rectangle in the window. Press a key on the keyboard or close the window to quit the program.

This program provides a nice starting point for those of you interested in using SDL and OpenGL in your games as well as anyone learning OpenGL.

Update (June 3, 2013)
---------------------

I added a branch named sdl2 that uses SDL2 and OpenGL.
